The goal of this exercise is to write a multi-process program that, given a string (the pattern) and a list of ﬁlenames of text ﬁles, counts the occurrences of the pattern in the ﬁles. The search should be done in parallel, creating one process for every text ﬁle to be analyzed. To accomplish this goal you will make use of the process management routines of the UNIX environment. Your C++ application will receive the pattern string and the ﬁlenames as command-line arguments. After checking that the correct number of parameters has been provided, your program will extract the number n of ﬁlenames provided in input and will create n child processes by repeatedly calling the system call fork(). Every child process will consider one ﬁle, will determine the number of occurrences of the pattern in that ﬁle and will write this number to a text ﬁle named result-PID.txt, with PID being the ID of the child process. Note that the search should be performed by replacing the image of the process with that of an instance of the shell executing the following command:  grep -o PATTERN FILENAME | wc -l > result-PID.txt . You can do this by means of the system call exec(), providing it with the path to the executable of the shell (typically, /bin/sh) and, as arguments of /bin/sh, the string -c and the string corresponding to the search command ( grep -o ... ). After spawning the children, the main process will wait for their completion (using the wait() system call) and check their termination status. If all children terminated correctly, the process will read the results ﬁles generated, compute the overall number of occurrences and print it to standard output.
